# Calculator-GUI-Python
A simple calculator in GUI made with Python and PyQt4

calc_basic_complete.py - An extremely basic calculator GUI with only 2 inputs

calc_full_code.py - A basic calculator which takes equations of numbers.

calc_basic.ui - The UI file for QtDesigner

calc_full.ui - The UI file for QtDesigner

The UI was designed in QtDesigner after which the design code was torn up and reassembled in different ways to suit my needs.
I have added simple and concise comments to my code and the code from QtDesigner is not commented at all.

Stuff you need to make this work:
    Python (I used 3.6)
    PyQt4  (I used 4.11.4)
